# Project Foundations
# Compressed learnings promoted from repeated pressure events.
# Each foundation has confidence 0-3 and evolves based on outcomes.
#
# Foundations can be PROJECT-scoped (local) or GLOBAL-scoped (universal).
# Global foundations live in ~/.decision-os and apply to all projects.
# Use `elevate_foundation` to promote a project foundation to global.
