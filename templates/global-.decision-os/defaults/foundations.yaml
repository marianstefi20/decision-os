# Global Foundations
# Universal learnings that apply across all projects.
# These are RECOMMENDATIONS, not rules. Project context always matters.
#
# ID prefix: GF- (Global Foundation)
# Confidence evolves based on validation across projects.
#
# Good candidates for global foundations:
# - Tool behaviors that don't depend on tech stack
# - Debugging strategies that work everywhere
# - Meta-learnings about process and decision-making
# - Cross-cutting patterns (logging, error handling, testing)
#
# NOT good candidates:
# - Tech-stack-specific patterns (keep in project)
# - Business domain logic (keep in project)
# - Team-specific conventions (keep in project)

#   default_behavior: "Before refactoring a function, identify all call sites and understand how each uses the function. Changes to signatures or behavior need to account for all callers."
